## 1 Viewing which shared object a process has loaded

To quickly view what shared objects are loaded by a process, say with pid 1234

```
cat /proc/1234/maps
```
 
It's useful to check if you've actually loaded a particular shared object.

```
cat /proc/1234/maps | grep libfuse
```

Might return a line like this (amongst others):

```
7f2848490000–7f28484ba000 r-xp 00000000 08:01 18092636 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libfuse.so.2.9.7
```
